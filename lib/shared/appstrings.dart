By now you’re well aware that the shoes are releasing once again on December 8th, 2018 in full family sizes, poised to shatter the record set by 2016’s Space Jams as the single best-selling sneaker release in brand history. Throughout the years, the famed colorway has appeared in a variety of iterations. Different numbers on the heel, details that didn’t make the cut, special versions made just for Michael himself, and even some possible counterfeits that appeared in shoe closets of the rich and famous.";

When the sneaker was first retroed, it was given the name Air Jordan 3 Retro 88 rather than its original, white cement. It is dressed in mostly white with details of black on the midsole and grey on the elephant print and outsole. Red accents the eyelets as wells as Jumpman.";

It was an atypical version of the classic, showcasing features and functions rather than delivering yet another color update to the silhouette.";
